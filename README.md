## Fact Checker & Fallacy Detector Browser Extension

*"Grammarly, but for fact and logical fallacy checking"*

The fact checking part of this was written by [Alyza
Tuchler](https://github.com/alex232890).

We plan on adding a fallacy detector.

The first milestone of this code is to create a browser extension that will 
analyze all text on a page (including text on images) and underline or 
highlight any potential false/unverified claims and logical fallacies.
